Checkers

Regular Rules
1. Black moves first
2. Regular pieces can only move one diagonal space toward the opponent's pieces
3. Capture a piece by "jumping" over it
4. Pieces can only be captured if the space opposite of the capturing piece is empty
5. When a piece reaches the further row from their respective side, it becomes a King Piece
6. King pieces can move backwards

Changes Made
1. You cannot capture multiple pieces even if possible

Wonky Code
1. The first click chooses the piece to move and the second click chooses where to move it/capture. 
   You have to click again if you decide you want to move a different piece.
   
   For example, you're playing black and click on the leftmost piece on the front row. You change 
   your mind and want to move the piece two spaces to the right instead. Click any non-valid square
   and then click on the new piece you want to move.
